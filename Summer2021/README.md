# Simulating Occulting Structures
The files in this folder are for simulating the light curves of occulting structures

## Generating Light Curves
The notebooks generatedShapes, varyingSize, doubleObject and repeatingObjects all do more or less the same thing. Each of these files contains code to generate a shape according to different parameters, generate a ligth curve using EightBitTransit and output the light curve in a text file. These notebooks also create visuals of the occulters and output them to png files
The notebooks differ slightly in the generation algorithms which are optimized for varying different parameters

## Injecting Signals in TESS Curves
The notebook injectSignal reads the signal text files outputed by the generation notebooks as well as TESS light curves. It then injects signal into the TESS light curve. This notebook outputs the injected light curves in pickle files, png files of the light curves and a csv file with the details of each of the light curves

## Misc Files
The notebook lookupEditor is for editing the csv files generated by injectSignal if I have made a mistake or need to change some of the data
